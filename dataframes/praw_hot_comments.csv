I didn't know the neighborhood, or the players, and stopped in with friends, more out of curiosity.  Is theirs like ours?  Better?  Or worse?\n\nA guy walked in.  Tricked out in an expensive suit with an entourage in tow.  ALL the dancers flocked over to him and fawned, the cocktail waitresses were the next tier, and the whole group was then surrounded by their club security staff.  The entourage was now three times larger.  \n\nThe guy made his way over to the DJ booth in the back, and the spinner came down out of the booth and some type of pleasantries were exchanged.  The guy handed the DJ what looked like some money from my vantage point and the DJ scurried back to his booth.\n\nThe two bartenders in the back had come around from the bar into the aisle way, one holding a cocktail and the other holding a cigar.  As the guy walked past, he traded a wad of cash to each.  He now held a drink in one hand, cigar in the other.\n\nHe made his way to the far back corner of the club, to a horseshoe shaped booth and some other dude magically appeared and pulled the table out into the aisle.  He got handed some cash.\n\nThen, this guy individually hugs and tips each of the dancers, then the waitresses.  He fist bumps one of the security guys and the group sits down.  The guy that pulled out the table scoots it back in and scurries off.\n\nSecurity was the last to disperse and as they did, a couple of them stayed behind.  Not at the table, but close by.\n\nGuy and his crew just stayed at the table.  Waitresses keep bringing drinks. About an hour later, a guy comes back from the kitchen area in a suit.  Walks up to the table, turns around and walks back into the kitchen.\n\nMr. Main Player gets up a short time later and walks back into the kitchen alone.\n\nI made a move to go past there to head to the restrooms.  From my peripheral, I caught the two back in a corner in conversation.  When I came back out, Mr. Man was back at his table.  Never saw the suited guy that came out of the kitchen again.\n\nOP's pic, combined with my recollections of some of the highlights of THAT guy's speech before legislators all brought back this memory.  Everyone fawning over him like they're getting paid well to do so.\n\nNow, what if the guy I saw in the club went into the kitchen to meet with the owner of the club to get some more of HIS cash to distribute to HIS workers?  Sure, he keeps enough to buy himself a suit and keep the entourage intact, but, there's plenty coming right back to the other players in the game, right there in the club, when they're supposed to be working for the customers that are there for what we all thought was the whole purpose of the club . . ."", ""That's how I imagine Lucifer to look.

Many computer monitors and TV tubes, when displaying pulsed images, emit pulsed electromagnetic fields of sufficient amplitudes to cause such excitation. It is therefore possible to manipulate the nervous system of a subject by pulsing images displayed on a nearby computer monitor or TV set. For the latter, the image pulsing may be imbedded in the program material, or it may be overlaid by modulating a video stream, either as an RF signal or as a video signal. The image displayed on a computer monitor may be pulsed effectively by a simple computer program. For certain monitors, pulsed electromagnetic fields capable of exciting sensory resonances in nearby subjects may be generated even as the displayed images are pulsed with subliminal intensity.""', ""A patent doesn't actually need to work to be a patent.

As in it doesn‚Äôt effect what I do either way. So on the subject of covid do I normally take a vaccine for a virus? If I have a weakened immune system then maybe the answer is yes. At least some kind of intervention would be necessary. Do I normally rely on my natural immunity? If that‚Äôs the case then it would be stupid to take an unnecessary medical procedure. I would just be exposing myself to the unknown risks of interfering with a complex system.\n\nOur bodies and immune system are complex in that no one fully understands all the variables at play. Even experts. So these experts could isolate a part of that complex system and say ‚ÄúOur intervention will effect this part of the system in this way‚Äù and be correct. But it will be impossible for them to understand all of the effects. Which is why we usually have long term studies to look for these unknown risks to then potentially stop the interference if they prove to be dangerous enough. For all this to be justified it would need to have been demonstrated through an open and honest discussion that natural immunity isn‚Äôt good enough. That hasn‚Äôt happened at all.\n\nWill the unknown side effects always be severe? No, but it will depend on the person‚Äôs unique situation and genetics. Maybe even the majority of people who take a vaccine don‚Äôt experience anything too bad. But for the portion of the population who were tricked and bullied into taking an unnecessary vaccine and experience life changing complications? Absolute travesty.', ""I have been a IT guy for 35 years.\nI'm a VERY good Systems Engineer.\nIF I wanted, I could have a Phd.\nYes. I am that good.\n\nStill. Probably once per week.

But I know more about Biology than many of them ever will."", 'There‚Äôs some good info in this book by the ‚Äúmedical heretic‚Äù Dr. Robert Mendelsohn, MD:\n\n**‚ÄúModern Medicine can\'t survive without our faith, because Modern Medicine is neither an art nor a science. It\'s a religion.** ^p.5\n\nOne definition of religion identifies it as any organized effort to deal with puzzling or mysterious things we see going on in and around us. The Church of Modern Medicine deals with the most puzzling phenomena: birth, death, and all the tricks our bodies play on us -- and we on them -- in between. In ""The Golden Bough,"" religion is defined as the attempt to gain the favor of ""powers superior to man which are believed io direct and control the course of nature and of human life.""\n\nIf people don\'t spend billions of dollars on the Church of Modern Medicine in order to gain favor with the powers that direct and control human life, what do they spend it on?\n\nCommon to all religions is the claim that reality is not limited to or dependent upon what can be seen, heard, felt, tasted or smelled. **You can easily test modern medical religion on this characteristic by simply asking your doctor Why? enough times.** Why are you prescribing this drug? Why is this operation going to do me any good? Why do I have to do that? Why do you have to do that to me?\n\nJust ask why? enough times and sooner or later you\'ll reach the Chasm of Faith. Your doctor will retreat into the fact that you have no way of knowing or understanding all the [18] wonders he has at his command. Just trust me.\n\nYou\'ve just had your first lesson in medical heresy. Lesson Number Two is that if a doctor ever wants to do something to you that you\'re afraid of and you **ask why? enough times until he says Just Trust Me,** what you\'re to do is turn around and put as much distance between you and him as you can, as fast as your condition will allow.\n\n**Unfortunately, very few people do that. They submit. They allow their fear of the witch doctor\'s mask, the unknown spirit behind it, and the mystery of what is happening and of what will happen to change into respectful awe of the whole show.‚Äù**\n\n‚ÄúDoctors in general should be treated with about the same degree of trust as used car salesmen.** Whatever your doctor says or recommends, you have to first consider how it will benefit him.‚Äù\n^p.21\n\n**‚ÄùTo protect yourself from the pusher-priest you again have to make the heretic\'s radical leap of unfaith. Don\'t trust your doctor. Assume that if he prescribes a drug, it\'s dangerous. There is no safe drug.** Eli Lilly himself once said that a drug without toxic effects is no drug at all. Every drug has to be approached with suspicion.\n^p.36\n\nAgain, **learning more about your situation than the doctor won\'t be all that difficult. Doctors get most of their information about drugs from advertisements and from detail men and their pamphlet handouts.** All you have to do is spend some time with a good book or two in order to get the information you need before deciding whether to take a drug or not.\n\n**The best book to start with is the Physicians\' Desk Reference, the PDR.** The PDR is the beginning of knowledge about drugs. Although it\'s easily available now, up until about two [80] years ago the publisher refused to distribute it to other than members of the medical profession.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOf course, you don\'t have to buy the book. Almost every public library now has it. **You shouldn\'t worry about understanding it. Anybody with an eighth grade education and a dictionary can read any medical book.** Even doctors will testify that patients always seem to be able to pick out and understand the parts that they must know.‚Äù\n\n[Confessions of a Medical Heretic](http://whale.to/c/Confessions-of-a-Medical-Heretic-pdf.pdf)\nRobert S.

In fact, my lovely sister invited me over to dinner one night, in the backyard of course, and also happen to invite some big wig doctor she knew over too have a conversation with me. Lol. Now this was at the beginning, and at this point I was deep into the research, examining the vaccine spike sequence. so the Dr eventually gets around to ask why don\'t I want to get it. And I said, ""for many reasons, it increases your changes of heart issues. both Pfizer and Moderna had more people die from heart issues in the vaccine arm than the placebo and since the LNP travels throughout your body infecting any organ I suspect that could be the issue, also it was designed to turn off your immune system."" He says, ""Oh no, quite the opposite,  It\'s designed to create an immune response."" I understand that part but they replaced all the uridine with pseudouridine in the rna sequence of the spike and they did that cause it mutes the toll like receptors specifically 4 and 7. Those receptors sense foreign rna. So for as long as your body is making spikes from the vaccine rna you will be more susceptible to getting sick."" He turned to my sister and said, ""your brother knows a lot"" and she said ""is what he saying true?"" The Dr said, ""honestly, I don\'t know. I\'d have to do some digging.""', '‚ÄúYou got me there but doctors ain‚Äôt perfect.

Doctors don't have time for that they regurgitate what their corporate overlords tell them is best. They have the best intentions but not always the best intel."", ""> The idea is that my extensive research couldn‚Äôt possibly compare to a doctor‚Äôs education\n\nYes, this is exactly the idea, nitwit. Doctors study intensively for years to develop their expertise; your watching a few YouTube videos doesn't even remotely compare.\n\nHave you ever heard of the Dunning-Kruger effect?"", ""Just don‚Äôt do it. Don‚Äôt argue or try to reason with narrative following, ignorant people who have not done any investigating into the world we live in or the lies we have been sold for profit. Without going into the idea that the people who make regulations, run education, or run corporations being in on a plan of dis-genics (which is the opposite of the idea of Eugenics which means good breeding or stock- because the elite only want eugenics for themselves and to have bad genetics among the rest of the population in order to encourage te masses into self culling) as their motive, instead it is easier to focus on the idea of profit being the main motive, our heath be damned.  Most ignorant people can often see profit as the motive for evil and malicious happenings through malpractice over it being an ideology of wanting to cull humanity.   \n\n\nAuthorities play the game so that it is difficult without loading heaps of information on people, to show that they behaved with malicious intent over just being ignorant and stupid.   \n\n\nThe ignorant masses have been brainwashed into a cult mentality of blindly believing the ‚Äúauthorities‚Äú and willful ignorance of anything that counters that ideology. The Authorities don‚Äôt hide the agenda or information, they simply encourage people to not look at it, and so people don‚Äôt. You can‚Äôt have a debate with cult members. You can‚Äôt rationalize your leaving the cult of belief to them with logical arguments because ignorant people live in the realm of logical fallacies as that is what their belief system is built upon.   \n\n\nWhen the ignorant people of today think about the idea of mind control they automatically go to the idea of things like MK ultra in it‚Äôs first few generations of programming, of what they may have seen in movies, and they assume that program ended and the research was abandoned.  It is hard for ignorant people to conceptualize that the program continued on the back of the trauma based mind control to be extended into technological uses and less invasive programming within the general public, because they know nothing about psychology, or how humans work. To admit this stuff is still happening damages the ego of the ignorant and shatters their world view and most people who aren‚Äôt looking for the deeper workings of our society and aiming for self improvement on their own, to have this idea foisted upon them by someone else, creates an immediate shut down response in their programming because they can‚Äôt deal with it.   \n\n\nNow you can say to people who use that ‚Äúyou‚Äòre not a doctor‚Äù argument that the statement itself is a logical fallacy and that one does not need to be a doctor to read the information put out. Most medical field textbooks are funded and often written by pharmaceutical companies. I saw this in my psychology classes and anatomy classes in college. In psychology the main slant on everything was to make all mental disturbances to be diseases that the symptoms can be treated with drugs. There was an obvious agenda in the textbook writing that trains the people going into that field. I switched majors because I couldn‚Äôt buy the BS narrative being sold and the professors were utterly brainwashed.   \n\n\nThe ignorant masses will read a few propaganda articles on the ‚Äúanti-vax‚Äù movement and will believe that those who actually look into the information and make choices outside the official recommendations by authorities to be the ignorant ones. They don‚Äôt see the information that they are consuming as mind control propaganda telling them not to look into it any deeper lest they fall into the ‚Äúcult‚Äù mentality of being ignorant and stupid. There‚Äôs a load of irony there. The ruling classes don‚Äôt have to hide what they are doing because they‚Äôve trained the masses to ignore the information they put out and only listen to the official narratives put out by mainstream controlled media. They have trained people to ignore the information and stay ignorant.   \n\n\nSo even if you come armed with a million internet tabs open to the information or a binder full of the info printed out, the ignorant won‚Äôt look at it cause they are trained not to. Much like an addict or alcoholic, the ignorant won‚Äôt be willing to change their position until they admit they have a problem. The ignorant don‚Äôt understand what eat informed consent is. They run on the confidence game (con job) that they have been trained in that doctor knows best and they should just blindly follow directions without understanding or looking into their own health or the information doctors provide as their best guesses since  that‚Äôs mostly what their profession is. The ignorant are kept in a childish mentality of certainty and black and white thinking because children are easier to control.   \n\n\nI can suggest looking into information about reprogramming cult members. This is actually valuable information when it comes to challenging the ignorant‚Äôs belief systems. But realize that this goes much deeper than just their beliefs that everyone should get jabbed for the greater good of society (which right there that mentality screams cult), once you pull the thread and insert disbelief into their world view some people can crumble mentally. Their whole world view can start to unravel and their protect the cult programming kicks in and they shut down conversations with logical fallacies in order to protect their programming.   \n\n\nThe other scary side of reprogramming is when people are vulnerable in the stage of unraveling, they can easily be swayed to build beliefs in a new system of propaganda and are apt to falling down the disinformation rabbit holes that have been set like snare traps by the ruling class. I‚Äôd venture a guess that 60% to 70% of conspiracy theories may fall into the counter intelligence disinfo psy-op. Belief systems are dangerous, clear, sound information is not.   \n\n\nSo your options are when someone wants to argue your personal medical choices, ‚Äúmy body, my choice‚Äù and in the case of children, ‚Äútheir body their choice until they can give true consent it is my job to protect that right of autonomy and do no harm to them‚Äù, or come armed with a crap load of information that is sound and verifiable (no conspiracy rabbit holes just the facts given by the medical community) and hope it plants the seeds of doubt into someone‚Äôs personal belief in the programmed narrative. When you reach a point where they are shutting the conversation down with logical fallacies, you have two options dependent upon your relationship with that person, pull out what logical fallacies are and go into why their argument is one, or end the conversation with, well it's my choice and you have no authority over my choice.

When we got married it took a year of trying to conceive (I was 33 he was 35) I gave him until I was 34.5 to get pregnant or we weren‚Äôt having kids, because I didn‚Äôt want to run risks after that of problematic pregnancies. So after a year literally like 3 weeks out from our wedding anniversary we were pregnant. Fast forward to 2020 and I started us on a bunch of hormone balancing herbs and various things to boost our natural immune systems, and towards the end of 2020 I started him on some testosterone boosting herbs. Low dose, and taking a 1 week break once a month. 3 months after starting this we ended up pregnant again, and we weren‚Äôt trying, in fact we were actively NOT trying. Using the same natural rhythm and condom prevention we had been using for 5 years since our first child. I was 41 at that point, and not happy about going through pregnancy this late in life.

Random accidental pregnancy while actively not trying (and also still tracking my cycle do not get pregnant) and after a year of hormone balancing herbs and a couple months of testosterone herbs his sperm decided to be super charged and not lazy bums. lol I had my tubes removed so I don‚Äôt have to worry about any more accidents, but it was interesting how that all happened.

Bretton Woods determined who ruled the world. ALL trade was done in US dollars. Russian leadership were told the missions were faked and refused to expose NASA, per Soviet journalist G.V. Smirnov ‚Äú In 1967, I worked in the editorial office of the Technique of Youth, when one of the employees brought a special issue of the American magazine Mechanix illustrated. ""It proved that the successes of the USSR in space are a bluff. Seeing the magazine, the chief editor Vasily Dmitrievich Zakharchenko instructed soviet leaders to dedicate a whole issue showing Apollo fakery! He took the magazine and went to the Central Committee of the CPSU. He returned after three hours extinguished, indifferent: ""They said - it is inappropriate...."". ""I was shocked; the Central Committee of the CPSU, which suffered from US propaganda, refused to do the same to the Americans""    \n\nAt the height of the cold war if the soviets come out and say ""NASA faked the moon landing"" it\'s as credible to Americans as Iran reporting 80 americans died in their missile strike. Literally laughed out of world diplomacy if the Russians did that. Any proof they offered would be called propaganda. Do you believe the Chinese now when they say they don\'t round up muslims and put them into camps, or that they dont steal organs? NO. Buzz himself ADMITTED the landings were faked    \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uluUQXiji4    \nriddled with guilt he became an alcoholic. His own kids and business partner have said he has dementia and alzheimer\'s.  Watch the astronauts gone wild interview...he clearly implies they faked the landing and wanted to discuss it in private vs being caught on tape when they were faking being halfway to the moon.    \nIt\'s not about what you know, it\'s about what you can prove. The Soviets DID NOT have the technology to prove NASA faked the landing as they could not monitor Apollo all the way to the moon surface. The soviets had no ability to track deep space spacecraft until after 1973 when their facilities gained deep space abilities, when the moon landings conveniently stopped. They used Jodrell bank...NASA controlled Jodrell bank . In 66\', Luna 9 photo\'s were printed in English newspapers before soviet ones. And the soviet craft were unprotected. NASA could crash a soviet probe if they wanted to. The CIA had moles all over the soviet government and space program. The head of the soviet space program is a US citizen.    \n\nThe exchange of moon samples limited Apollo samples to only 5 of 51 soviet labs. ""There was no unity of approach in either the research methodology of the compared soils, or in the presentation of the results of these studies. For example, the American soil is investigated in one spectral range, and the Soviet - in another. This does not happen if the compared samples are in the same hands. And, as Y.I. convincingly shows in his book, the scientific results in the articles of the ‚Äúlabs who apparently got apollo samples‚Äù are clearly ‚Äúglued together‚Äù from dissimilar parts: the own results of research on the Soviet soil and the sent results of the American soil research. This suggests that ""for some reason the American lunar soil was inaccessible to Soviet scientists."" Why did this happen? Apparently, the Americans, instead of the soil, sent the corresponding ‚Äúdata‚Äù to their few ‚Äútrusted‚Äù Soviet scientists so that they would present them as their own results. The articles of the Americans mention the receipt of the Soviet lunar soil (3.2 g) in exchange for the American one. But not one American or one of the 51 Soviet articles in the collection ‚ÄúLunar Soil from the Sea of \u200b\u200bPlenty‚Äù mentions how much of the lunar material the United States transferred to the USSR in this exchange"".     \n\nIn addition, the grain deal made with the soviets ensured Russians didnt starve to death in a mao style apocalypse.  US grain ensured the survival of the russians. ""The moon missions were faked!""...yeah ok, no more grain for you would have been the result.    \n\nThe soviets then partnered with NASA on faking space BS right after apollo ended. They do it for the same reason NASA does it. Black budget billions and military research while putting on a show for the public, like creating velcro. All rockets are ballistic missiles.  Most are shot into the sea and dont even have astroNOTS on board    \nhttps://streamable.com/jyhu69    \n\nAnd again, vast majority of photo\'s were released after 1994 and the invention of photoshop.

I believe the awareness Russia had of the Illuminati and Freemasons before the Monarch was dismantled was real.  It was the Freemasons and the Rothschild who reformed the world order just prior to this time, caused so many wars like the Nepoleonic Wars, and overthrow Monarchs.Anyways, the Rothschilds and Russia in turn went to war with one another.  One of the Rothschilds Illuminati bankers said something like this 'There will be consequences for the Monarch of Russia one day.'  Then communism came, and what happened?  The entire Russian Royal Family was killed, some by the bayonet by some 'drunk guards'.  The communist leaders back then have some VERY rare photographs like Lenin and Stalin shown doing masonic gestures at their first public appearances.  They even made statues of them doing these masonic gestures, and it is frozen in time.  Another thing, Nazi Germany could have also been a Rothschild invention, for the Wehrmacht Republic was in shambles during the Great Depression, their currency was worth less than toilet paper and somehow out of all of this they became rich again and created serious capital to rebuild and restructure Germany into a powerhouse almost overnight.  The Rothschild Illuminati bankers again, probably creating another system that might reform society for the world, except this time from an ultra-rightwing cause while Russia was an ultra-leftwing cause.  The treaty of Versailles in WW1 put Germany 132 billion gold marks in debt, or about $269 billion today.  There is no conspiracy theory that they received massive investment.                                                                                               Anyways, like anyone today, we weren't there to witness any of this.  Whatever they write into history is what is told, we don't really know everything and I don't claim to.  But, I thought just the possibility of something between the richest bankers of the world and the Russian Monarch might have been the straw that broke the camels back and brought communism to the world.  Communism might have been a reform for another world order, actually it was.  And whether or not people agree or disagree on whether it killed many people, I'd say it probably wasn't a good time for the Russians and Chinese when it first hit.  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcYkv9wZ-fE"", 'We sold a huge amount of grain to the Soviets at below market value at the height of the supposed Cold War.

It is believed to contain patterns and proportions that underlie all of creation and to encode the harmonic frequencies of the cosmos.\n\nSome people believe that meditating on or working with it can align the individual with universal principles and awaken spiritual insights. It is named after the archangel Metatron and is associated with the ""Tree of Life"" in Jewish and Christian mysticism.\n\nThe Merkabah (within Metatrons cube)\n\nThe merkaba, also spelled merkabah or merkava, is a geometric figure that is associated with various spiritual and metaphysical beliefs and practices. It is often depicted as a three-dimensional, star-shaped figure that is made up of two intersecting, three-sided pyramids, or tetrahedra.\n\nIn some spiritual traditions, the merkaba is believed to be a powerful symbol of spiritual evolution and enlightenment, and is thought to represent the union of the physical and spiritual aspects of the self. It is often associated with the concept of the ""ascension"" or the process of transitioning from a physical body to a higher state of consciousness.\n\nThe merkaba is also said to be a powerful tool for meditation and visualization, and is believed to have the ability to generate a field of energy that can protect and heal the individual. Some people believe that the merkaba can be activated through focused intention and visualization, and that it can help to align the individual with cosmic energies and connect them with higher states of consciousness.\n\nThought Forms: Polyhedra & Musical Resonance, & The Pentagram (top right)\n\nPolyhedra are 3D shapes made of flat faces and straight edges. There are many different types, including the 5 Platonic solids, which are regular shapes with congruent faces and edges, and the 13 Archimedean solids, which are semi-regular shapes with a mix of congruent and non-congruent faces and edges. Polyhedra are studied for their mathematical properties and are also used in computer graphics and engineering\n\nThere have been various attempts over the years to connect polyhedra with musical resonance or to use polyhedra as a basis for musical instruments or compositions. Some people believe that the symmetry and proportions of polyhedra can be used to create harmonically pleasing musical structures, and that the resonances of polyhedra can be used to create healing or transformative soundscapes.\n\nThe pentagram is often used in Western music to represent the five lines of a staff. The staff is a set of five lines on which musical notes are written, and the pentagram represents these lines with the top line representing the highest pitch and the bottom line representing the lowest pitch. The pentagram has also been used to symbolize the five human senses and the power of music to evoke strong emotions and spiritual experiences.\n\nThe pentagram: or five-pointed star, has been used as a symbol by a variety of different cultures and belief systems throughout history. In some cases, the pentagram has been associated with satanic beliefs and practices, but it is important to note that the symbol has a much broader history and significance.\n\nREVELATIONS 21:17 (top right of Metatron cube)\n\nRevelation 21:17 is a verse in the New Testament book of Revelation, which is the final book of the Christian Bible. The verse reads:\n\n""And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel."" (King James Version) In this verse, the ""wall"" being measured is the wall of the New Jerusalem, which is described as a city that descends from heaven to earth in the book of Revelation. The wall is said to be 144 cubits tall, which is a unit of measurement that is equivalent to about 66 feet or 20 meters. The verse also mentions that the measurement of the wall was taken ""according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel,"" which suggests that the wall was sized to be appropriate for human or angelic beings.\n\nThe table of lambda: (bottom left corner of Metatron cube)\n\nThe table of lambda, also known as the lambda table or the lambda distribution, is a statistical tool that is used to compare the means of two groups or samples. It is based on the statistical test called the ""t-test,"" which is used to determine whether the difference between the means of two groups is statistically significant, or whether it could have occurred by chance.\n\nUnified Field Theory: (right edge side of Metatron cube)\n\nUnified field theory is a concept in physics that seeks to unify the fundamental forces of nature into a single theoretical framework. It is based on the idea that all of the fundamental forces in the universe, including electromagnetism, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and gravity, are different expressions of a single underlying force or field. While unified field theory is an active area of research in physics, it is currently a theoretical concept and has not been fully developed or verified.\n\nCosmic Superluminal Frequency, Wave Patterns, & The Fib Spiral (spiral on upper left)\n\nI believe the creator misspelled superluminal as ‚Äòsupraliminal‚Äô. Superluminal, or faster-than-light frequencies are frequencies that are believed to be able to travel faster than the speed of light. The speed of light is a fundamental constant in the universe, and is widely considered to be the ultimate speed limit for all forms of matter and energy.\n\nThe spiral itself has a striking resemblance to the Fibonacci spiral\n\nFibonacci Spiral (wave pattern)\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence appears in many areas of mathematics and has numerous applications in science, art, and other fields. The Fibonacci spiral has several interesting properties, including the fact that it is self-similar, meaning that it is made up of smaller copies of itself, and that it is an approximate golden spiral, meaning that it approximates the golden ratio, a mathematical ratio that is believed to be aesthetically pleasing and that appears in many natural and man-made objects. The Fibonacci spiral is often used as a design element in art and architecture, and it is also of interest to scientists studying the structure and growth of plants and other natural forms.\n\nEdit: In conclusion, everything is consciousness.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/conspiracy) if you have any questions or concerns.*', ""Strange points about Australia's favorite gun control false flag incident:\n\n1. On the Sunday morning, two hours before the murders, ten of the senior managers of Port Arthur were taken to safety many miles away up the east coast,for a two day seminar with a vague agenda and no visiting speakers. Was the timing of this trip a mere coincidence?\n\n2. Also just before the shootings the only two policemen in the region were called away on a wild goose chase. They were sent to the Coal Mine at Salt Water River, to investigate a heroin drug stash which turned out to be soap powder. This was too far for them to get to the Broad Arrow Cafe in time to be of any use. Had a policeman remained at Dunalley he would have closed the swing bridge to prevent the killer(s) from escaping from the peninsula. Did Bryant, IQ 66, organise this decoy?\n\n3. Big Mortuary Truck. Before the massacre, a specially-built 22 person capacity mortuary truck was built. It attracted some derision at the time, but its effective use at Port Arthur was unquestioned. After the massacre it was advertised, unsuccessfully, for sale via the internet, then converted for another purpose. Without the foresight of Port Arthur, why build it? When it had proven its worth, why get rid of it? Another coincidence?\n\n4. Martin Bryant has never been properly identified as the gunman. A young woman who ate her lunch near the gunman just before 1.30 said he had a freckled face. Graham Collyer, the wounded ex-soldier, who had the best opportunity to observe the killer, said he had a pock-marked or acned face. Neither description fits Bryant who has a beautifully smooth complexion. Graham Collyer says that it was not Bryant who shot him in the neck.\n\n5. Illegal Photo. On 30th April the Hobart Mercury printed an old photo of Martin Bryant on the front page. This was illegal because at that stage some of the witnesses had not yet been asked to identify the killer, and the photo would have become fixed in the minds of the witnesses. When one witness was asked to describe the clothing worn by the gunman, she described the clothing on the old photo instead of what the gunman had worn. The Mercury newspaper was not prosecuted for breaking the law.\n\n6. Mrs Wendy Scurr, nurse, tour guide and Ambulance Officer, rang the police at 1.32 pm to report the shooting. She and other medics then cared for the injured and the dead without any police protection for six and a half hours. Who ordered the armed police to stop at Tarana, where they had a barbecue? The police who arrived by boats were a stone‚Äôs throw away from the main crime scene, the cafe, and they too failed to come in to see what was going on. Was this meant to increase the trauma of the survivors?\n\n7. Three more shots were fired at Port Arthur at 6.30pm while Bryant was at Seascape. Who fired those shots?\n\n8. There was a conference on emergency medicine on in hobart at the same time so there were many experts there able to deal with the victims.\n\n9. Many witnesses claimed the shooter was right handed and shot from the hip. When asked to show how he did the shooting Bryant (left handed) raised an imaginary rifle but up to his shoulder and mimed it out like the movies.\n\n10. There was a politician who said if we don't get gun control soon there'll be a massacre in tasmania.\n\n>There's so many other ones too. It was a really sloppily executed false flag that wouldn't have worked in today's internet age.\n\n>Interesting theory on who the shooter really was is Israeli super spy Ari Ben Menashe. One of only a handful of people in the world who could pull off the beirut triple that was executed that day. 3 shots on a moving vehicle; one for sighting, one to the driver and one to the engine to immobilize the vehicle as if it were a car bomb.\n\n>Another interesting theory is that Ben Menashe is actually Joe Vialis... an early researcher who broke a lot of the information regarding the actual facts of the conspiracy and early truther on 9/11."", 'This is why I visit Conspiracy.

If you simultaneously split a large amount of atoms of very heavy elements you have an explosion. \n\nHeavy elements are radioactive (they are constantly firing particles). \n\nIf you put together enough mass of a radioactive element (critical mass), then by mere statistics these firing particles impact other atoms and it is assured that a chain reaction will occur. \n\nThis is the firing mechanism of a nuclear weapon, ideally you have small amounts of the radioactive element separated in the bomb chamber.

I confess that before I made this experiment I was in some fear. I said to my assistants, ‚ÄòI do not know what will happen. If the conclusions of certain scientists are right, the release of energy from the splitting of an atom may mean an explosion which would wreck our apparatus and perhaps kill someone.

You are probably too young to know what happened with the IBM PC.\n\nOriginally designed to be a single tasking system, people quickly wanted to run multiple applications at the same time. Software developers were quickly running up against the ""Who needs more than 640k?"" RAM limit of Bill Gates. Memory prices were plunging, so a bunch of different solutions for ""extended memory"" appeared on the market, all of which used different addressing schemes to access this ""high"" (above 640k) memory. \n\nFor simple programs that people wanted quick access to, but didn\'t interfere with the ""main"" program people were using - usually a word processor or spreadsheet - developers created ""TSR"" - terminate and stay resident - applications for contact lists, to-do notes, etc. \n\nAll sounds great until you\'re the guy who gets called when something doesn\'t work. Then, you have to try to figure out what combination of high memory, software, and application that luser\'s particular configuration has, usually with zero help from said luser, who doesn\'t know what software he\'s running, how much memory he has, etc. It was a nightmare. \n\nI had a similar experience in industry. We sold computerized telephone systems. Ours were the size of bar fridge, and didn\'t need air conditioning, while our competitors were the size of at least two upright fridges that required a special AC room. We sold our systems to big electrical distributors, like Union Electric or RCA, and they sold them to small telcos, and what were called ""interconnects"" - guys who connected private systems to the public network, which had only been legalized in 1968. \n\nMany of the people who sold our systems were solid, but some were fly-by-nights, who\'d buy a system for a few grand, install it in a few hours (it\'s not that hard if the wiring is in place), and take off. We found some pretty bad practices - grounding the system to the centre screw on a 110-v outlet faceplate, for example. As the manufacturer, it was our reputation that suffered, not that of the fly-by-night. \n\nAnd because of laws in the US, it was very hard to implement a system where you only sold to registered dealers because of anti-trust and restraint of trade. So we were still at the mercy of these cheap installers, making a quick buck, while we paid the price with our reputation and future sales. \n\nSo I understand where Apple is coming from. You buy a \'black box\' from them that you can\'t screw with, but they in turn can guarantee that they can fix the problem. (Well, that\'s the deal in theory.. in practice, we all know it\'s something different...) They don\'t have to contend with six million different after market parts, they don\'t have to worry about software that screws with the OS, they don\'t have to worry that the non-Apple guy working on something screwed up some wiring when his screwdriver slipped, etc. It makes their repair and return centre a lot easier to manage, which presumably keeps costs down for us.

So instead of Apple saying ‚Äúplease turn in your iPhone for potential fire danger ‚Äú they just outright prevent the phones from working in the first place if the phone detected a potential anomaly. ‚ÄúThis message will appear on new phones with malfunctioning battery ‚Äú From a safety standpoint this is far better and more control over what the user then decides to do. ‚ÄúProbably upgrade ‚Äú. \n\nI guess it‚Äôs a form of you own nothing and will be happy, but unless you have the skills to maintain the device to spec, it‚Äôs a hazard to the user and anyone around them ‚Äúsay phone bursts on a plane‚Äù to continue having in there possession', ""I already own nothing and I'm happy\n\nWtf I love Klaus Schwab now!."", 'Not Lenovo\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfish', 'BMW subscription seats subsidize the cost for all cars to be built with heated seats. You can buy a lifetime subscription of around 3500$ ""or about the cost of what it would typically be to add that as an option.\n\nBMW, in its poor marketing, didn\'t explain this well. So from the outside, it looks really shitty. But when you break down the costs, it makes sense. I think it was Maryland that now requires BMW to not sell that subscription, So in turn, it cost that much more to purchase. Sucks for everyone because no longer a choice because the government stepped in!\n\nAlso, they fail to mention that for the life of your subscription, your seats are guaranteed to work. So if you do the subscription route and own the car for 20 years, Well.... BMW might not like you. The average ownership of a BMW is 3 years. So by the time the customer turns in the car, the subscription would actually be cheaper than purchasing the heated seats as an added option.\n\nToyota is the same thing. All cars now include a feature they would not normally come with. So they instead sold it as a subscription. Which, again, they have poor marketing.\n\nThese manufacturers are not adding features for free. And they tell you that upfront when you go to buy them. if you want the added features to continue working, pay more at purchase or buy the subscription.\n\nAMG is pulling what tesla did early on. You could buy a lower-capacity battery version, and with a software update, you could increase it. This has to do with streamlining production and having a single line. Also, again the customer has a choice if they want the subscription, which guarantees the added capability no matter the wear and tear. This could also bite them back for owners that hold onto a car for more than 3 years. The average AMG owner flips every 18 months. So again, cost savings, and the customer does have a choice between subscription and full ownership. But its stupid and expenisive.\n\nApple is removing airdrop as a functionality -\n\nYou own the hardware, not the service. It\'s shitty, But unless you\'re running a phone with some open OS, it\'s something you got to be prepared for. This has been the case since the software. If you apart of any Wiichat, you will know that this was circumvented already with jailbreaks. And when the CPP says turn off airdrop or we block all iPhone services and pull whatever funds we have in apple out. Or they could just simply block the iphone from having service. That\'s definitely a china CCP issue.\n\nWhen I first started going to school in 2004 for photography, A license for photoshop suite cost roughly 3200$. So when they went to subscription, honestly, I understood. You also had to pay for support if you had some special request or feature that you needed. So that was a bit annoying. And since then, I still have paid less in subscription than a new copy of Photoshop. Right now im about 2400$. So iv saved 800$ in the lifetime of needing to own photoshop.\n\nWindows 11. This one is tricky. In the professional sector, you can still get ownership licenses of windows 11. its just you have to have some IT certification now.\n\nBut lets break this down. When was the last time you paid for a windows subscription? I think mine was windows 7. and even then, i had a Technet subscription that came with, i think 100 window keys free a year. It was like 120$\n\nFrom there, iv got perpetual upgrades for free because that was something windows always offered when upgrading to a new-gen OS. You could even move your Serial key to a new motherboard so that you could keep using the same key over and over.\n\nSo literally, in the last 10+ years, i paid 120$ for all the new generations of windows. I don\'t expect to have complete ownership of them.\n\nWhen you buy a computer, you buy the computer and still own it. it can still function to the spec of what you bought it. but you may need to switch OS. This is why SteamOS is starting to see a huge uptick in the pc market. There\'s now a competitive free option alternative to windows that users have a choice to use on the hardware they purchase.\n\nEvery laptop manufacturer offers a Linux option of some kind. It\'s normally some flavor of Ubuntu.\n\nI agree with you on DRM for video games and video game exclusives. Unfortunately, everything nowadays is designed as a live service from the start. By design, it was never meant to last longer than the planned lifespan of the product. But honestly, the gaming space is a mess right now, and this is a whole different subject entirely. All these mobile game companies are related to actual casinos and gambling LLCs.\n\nNot sure why you didn\'t include M1 and M2. That\'s practically the most open-source platform in existence. Its super easy to run Linux on any m1 or m2 MacBook pro. \n\nReparability is about as easy as a Lenovo. You buy the mainboard for 650 and replace it. Unlesss you have the ability to SMD repair your not getting much further than that.']"

Say autism and Tourette‚Äôs for example, we have a condition called PANDAS (pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric disorder associated with strep). It‚Äôs caused by streptococcus triggering your own immune system to attack your basal ganglia and the dopamine receptor. This can mimic or present as autism, OCD, Tourette‚Äôs, and other behavioral disorders.\n\nAutoimmunity is seldom detected, and will manifest in ways that will get misdiagnosed. You won‚Äôt figure it out unless you have a good doctor that does extensive testing, maybe for years. It‚Äôs such a complex topic that average mind would implode, let alone the doctors with their ego. It‚Äôs one of the hardest things to treat as well. In comparison, cancer and diabetes seem like a much cuter option.\n\nMost people have chronic autoimmunity to some degree. They likely don‚Äôt even realize it. They‚Äôre probably misdiagnosed, as arthritis, depression and such.  \n\nFor autoimmunity, you will want to be eliminating 98% of the food items. Meat, salt, and water would be a perfect example. But that‚Äôs really difficult to maintain. Cutting out vegetable oils, processed foods, gluten, soy, dairy, and high lectin foods will be good enough.\n\nYou‚Äôll want to take high dose of vitamin D3, 5000 - 40000 IU per day. Along with magnesium and vitamin K.\n\nVitamin A \n\nThiamine (TTFD)\n\nFor blood clotting, you‚Äôll want to take vitamin K, thiamine, and vitamin C.\n\nI hear that NAC is good for detoxing the vaccine. I don‚Äôt know how much of that is true. But if raising glutathione is one of the main factors, then you‚Äôre in luck because I‚Äôve written a comprehensive article on that in the past (my website got deleted by google)\n\nNAC\n\nButyrate\n\nR-Lipoate\n\nSulforaphane (broccoli sprout extract)\n\nVitamin E\n\nVitamin C\n\nGlycine\n\nResveratrol\n\nCurcumin\n\nIodine\n\nSelenium\n\nI would also get C60. This is like the queen of the chess game. It‚Äôs the vegan adrenochrome. \n\nIf you got the cash, there‚Äôs nothing wrong about having them all on hand. You don‚Äôt take all of them everyday, but being able to cycle them is nice. I personally have all of them. Be careful as supplements can be almost as powerful, if not more, than pharmaceuticals.\n\nWell I probably wrote all this for nothing.

We are gobbling up all of the remaining productivity of the planet at a blinding speed. The United Nations is supporting this overpopulation experiment, otherwise, many nations would have collapsed long ago. We have added 5 billion people since 1960, in just 62 years. There is no soft landing at all planned for this experiment. 1/4 of the world's nations are already experiencing various stages of total collapse. Their problem? They can not feed their excessively large populations, global resources are scarce, and they have no control over the planet's climate engineered weather.\n\nThe powers that be exist as only the biggest unassailable criminals, who hide behind smaller elected criminals which masquerade as legitimate governments in front of gullible populations. Only a government can have the right to enforce any banking system, laws, the collection of debt, the monopoly on violence, and imprisonment. Today's world is highly in debt and grossly over-leveraging it. Ultimately, we are all in debt to the central bankers (today's modern day royalty) and their network of large banks in each country.\n\nThe central bankers, big oil, industrial-AG, multi-national corporations, and the military are running this population experiment, or short form MIC (military-industrial-complex). Limits to growth have been reached in all arenas, and we are running off of calculable finite supplies. There is going to be nothing left in the pipe for the 2030s, everything is being used to feed the business-as-usual machine for the remaining 2020s. We will not enter resource wars because there will not be enough of anything of significance to even go around very soon. Global military powers have derailed the global climate system; this ever escalating global dimming experiment over the last 75 years, has guaranteed an abrupt massive global climate collapse extinction level event. The global skies are get dimmer, silvery-white aerosolized, wildfires are raging, overall global precipitation is tanking, and chemical ice nucleation cool-down operations are running rampant. The jet stream is being pushed, pulled, and twisted in every direction, and the ozone layer above is collapsing alongside it. All are harbingers of abrupt climate collapse, especially when it all collapses.\n\nWe live in the end times and people have an acute sense that everything is failing and that the system is crossing its final  breaking points. Help and or handouts are not coming anymore for the most vulnerable of people; they are now being left to take things and matters into their own hands. The young and disenfranchised people feel no need to play by the rules if the rules are clearly counterintuitive and counterproductive, and following them obediently leaves them starving, destitute, in debt, trampled on, unrepresented politically, and homeless. A collapsing system affects the entire spectrum of the population.\n\nWhat is their plan?\n\nEvery experiment has to end, even this grotesque overpopulation one. The most inexpensive form of depopulation is utilizing bio-engineered pathogens with a high fatality rate that are sprayed from thousands of droned and manned aircraft. Climate, biosphere, and biodiversity collapse is doing the job as we speak. A nuclear winter would also work.\n\nThe United Nations has built an interconnected network of subterranean cities below your feet; the psychopaths plan to escape underground.\n\nWhat happens when all the big box stores inevitably shut down and there are no other stores left to steal from?\n\nThe system is being artificially propped up for maintaining the facade of business as usual. The large big box stores will not shut down until the whole jig is finally up. They will just raise prices, ration limited items, and the consumers will have to find substitutes on missing things in the meanwhile. Everything else that is stocked in the big box stores is just to keep upholding the throwaway economy; there is no transition into anything sustainable being lined up to replace it all.\n\nWill the thieves come to your house next?\n\nThere is nothing profitable to steal from our homes besides vehicles, electronics, and delivered packages. That is unless you are hoarding gold, silver, jewelry, narcotics, and weapons.
